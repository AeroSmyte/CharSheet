# QuickChar

<p align="center"

QuickChar is an ambitious, quick character sheet index. Store, add, edit, and show off the barebones sheet needed to sit down at a table and play your favorite TTRPG. Using SwiftUI, I've been trying to incorporate the game sheets for my friend's games. I'm using SwiftData to persist user data, SwiftUI, and have been searching for other frameworks to include in future updates.
